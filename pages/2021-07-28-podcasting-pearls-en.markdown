## Podcasting pearls âœ¨

Podcasts are going through a boom. 
Independent, professionals, tech, marketing, sales, radios, 
everybody's rushing on this format and it's getting hard to get signal through the noise.   

At some point I realized I wanted to have my podcasts notes close to the content.    
It did not find this in any app, so I started with my personal site.   

I wish one day we'll have "underline" and "surround" features in podcast apps.  
In  the meantime, I'll stick to this website.   
You can find podcast articles titled "Podcasting Pearls #...", it's a reference to [Programming Pearls](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Pearls-2nd-Jon-Bentley/dp/0201657880).  
There is a mix of engineering, economics, psychology, but you should mostly expect data engineering.     
Good listening !
