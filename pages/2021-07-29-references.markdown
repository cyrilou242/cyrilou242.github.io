## La crème de la crème

### Academics and learning

* [_Designing Data-Intensive Applications_](https://dataintensive.net/) - Martin Kleppmann  
  Foundations of data engineering.
* [_Head First Design Patterns_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58128.Head_First_Design_Patterns) -  Eric Freeman, Elisabeth Robson  
  Entertaining book. Try the O'reilly "Head First" series with this one. Also, try to get the first edition, the new one looks bad.
* [_Effective Java_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34927404-effective-java) - Joshua Bloch  
  Idiomatic, high-quality Java. Makes you think deeply about the language.
* [_Streaming Systems_](http://streamingsystems.net/) - Tyler Akdiau, Slava Chernyak, Reuven Lax  
  Foundations of distributed computing for streaming. Starting with [101](https://www.oreilly.com/radar/the-world-beyond-batch-streaming-101/) and [102](https://www.oreilly.com/radar/the-world-beyond-batch-streaming-102/) is enough.
* [Code Complete](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4845.Code_Complete) - Steve McConnell  
  Decades of trenches knowledge distilled. Reading this book instantaneously makes you a better developer.
* [Refactoring](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44936.Refactoring "Refactoring") - Martin Fowler  
  I didn't like this book at first. I found it way too verbose and procedural. Important ideas tend to be hidden by useless repetitive explanations. Still, I cant' deny it had a major impact on how I approach changes in big codebases.
* [_Concurrency in practice_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/127932.Java_Concurrency_in_Practice) - Brian Goetz, Tim Peierls, Joshua Bloch, Joseph Bowbeer, David Holmes, Doug Lea  
  Threads are tricky. Used as a reference.
* [_Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach,_](http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/) - Stuart Russell, Peter Norvig  
  Foundations of AI. Nice to use as a reference.
* [_Deep Learning with Python_](https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-python) - François Chollet  
  A hands-on practical book to build Deep Learning models. Excellent ROTI.
* [_Trustworthy Online Controlled Experiments_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51635906-trustworthy-online-controlled-experiments) - Ron Kohavi, Diane Tang, Ya Xu  
  Years of hard-earned knowledge in a simple, actionable book. Great for both left-to-right read and reference.

### Fictions

* [_Brave New World_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5129.Brave_New_World) - Aldous Huxley A totalitarian regime with Western methods.
* [_1984_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40961427-1984?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=zY0FCMwHcw&rank=1) - George Orwell  
  A totalitarian regime with Eastern methods.
* [_The Robot series_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41804.I_Robot?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=6G5binNbho&rank=1) - Isaac Asimov The beginning of the Robot series is actually about debugging automatons. Kinda like post-mortems stories.

### Non-fictions

* [_The Culture of Narcissism: American Life in An Age of Diminishing Expectations_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38212112-the-culture-of-narcissism?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=0gJHo8AKXV&rank=1) - Christopher Lasch "Narcissism, not only as an individual ailment but also as a burgeoning social epidemic".
* [_The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/931984.The_Presentation_of_Self_in_Everyday_Life?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=oj77vP9xfB&rank=1) - Erving Goffman Human behavior in social situations.
* [_The Sense of Style_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20821371-the-sense-of-style?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=9kYYA7O5Jr&rank=1) - Steven Pinker How to write well.

## Comics

### Franco-Belge

* [_Asterix in Switzerland_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/122438.Asterix_in_Switzerland) - René Goscinny, Albert Uderzo  
  French "Bédé" at its best.
* [_Cigarettes : Le dossier sans filtre_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52723789-cigarettes) - Pierre Boisserie, Stéphane Brangier  
  Exceptionally well-documented graphical document about the tobacco business in all its aspects: historical, economic, marketing, medical, political, environmental. Eye-opening.
* [_Il faut flinguer Ramirez_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40390595-il-faut-flinguer-ramirez) - Nicolas Petrimaux  
  Modern French comic. Makes fun of American film productions of a certain epoch, with nice humor and impactful arts.
* [Le monde sans fin](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59478153-le-monde-sans-fin "Le monde sans fin") - Christophe Blain (Illustrator), Jean-Marc Jancovici

### US Comics

* [_Watchmen_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/472331.Watchmen) - Alan Moore, Dave Gibbons, John Higgins  
  The monument. Apart from all other possible praises, I find the coloring amazing.
