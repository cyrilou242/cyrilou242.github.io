## La crème de la crème

### Academics and learning
- [_Designing Data-Intensive Applications_][designing-data] - Martin Kleppmann  
Foundations of data engineering.
- [_Head First Design Patterns_][design-patterns] -  Eric Freeman, Elisabeth Robson  
Entertaining book. Try the O'reilly "Head First" series with this one. Also try to get the first edition, the new one looks bad.
- [_Effective Java_][effective] - Joshua Bloch  
Idiomatic, high quality Java. Makes you think deeply about the language.
- [_Streaming Systems_][streaming-sys] - Tyler Akdiau, Slava Chernyak, Reuven Lax  
Foundations of distributed computing for streaming. Starting with [101][s-101] and [102][s-102] is enough.
- [Code Complete][complete] - Steve McConnell  
Decades of trenches knowledge distilled. Reading  this books instantaneously makes you a better developer.  
- [_Concurrency in practice_][concurrency] - Brian Goetz, Tim Peierls, Joshua Bloch, Joseph Bowbeer, David Holmes, Doug Lea  
Threads are tricky. Used as a reference.
- [_Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach,_][ai-russel] - Stuart Russell, Peter Norvig  
Foundations of AI. Nice to use as a reference. 
- [_Deep Learning with Python_][dl-python] - François Chollet  
Hands-on practical book to build Deep Learning models. Excellent ROTI.
- [_Trustworthy Online Controlled Experiments_][experiment] - Ron Kohavi, Diane Tang, Ya Xu  
Years of hard-earned knowledge in a simple, actionable book. Great for both left-to-right read and reference.  

### Fictions
- [_Brave New World_][brave_new_world] - Aldous Huxley
A totalitarian regime with Western methods.
- [_1984_][nineteen_eighty] - George Orwell  
A totalitarian regime with Eastern methods.
- [_The Robot series_][asimov] - Isaac Asimov
The beginning of the Robot series is actually about debugging automatons. Kinda like post-mortems stories. 


### Non-fictions
- [_The Culture of Narcissism: American Life in An Age of Diminishing Expectations_][narcissism] - Christopher Lasch
"Narcissism, not only as an individual ailment, but also a as burgeoning social epidemic". 
- [_The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life_][self_presentation] - Erving Goffman 
 Human behavior in social situations.
- [_The Sense of Style_][sense_style] - Steven Pinker
How to write well.


## Comics
### Franco-Belge
- [_Asterix in Switzerland_][asterix] - René Goscinny, Albert Uderzo  
French "Bédé" at its best.   
- [_Cigarettes : Le dossier sans filtre_][cigarettes] - Pierre Boisserie, Stéphane Brangier    
Exceptionally well documented graphical document about the tobacco business in all its aspects: historical, economic, marketing, medical, political, environmental. Eye-opening.
- [_Il faut flinguer Ramirez_][ramirez] - Nicolas Petrimaux   
Modern French comic. Makes fun of american film productions of a certain epoch, with nice humour and impactful arts.


### US Comics
- [_Watchmen_][watchmen] - Alan Moore, Dave Gibbons, John Higgins  
The monument. Apart from all other possible praises, I find the coloring amazing.
- [_Batman: The Dark Knight Returns_][batman] - Frank Miller, Klaus Janson, Lynn Varley  
Inside the troubled mind of the Batman.

### Mangas
- [_Golden Kamuy_][kamuy]  
Beautiful Japanese/Ainu cultural, historical tale. Humour is amazing. 
- [_Hunter X Hunter_][hxh]    
The only young-boy shonen that does not suffer from me growing.
- [_Kengan Ashura_][ashura] - Sandrovich Yabako, Daromeon  
Fights fights fights.
