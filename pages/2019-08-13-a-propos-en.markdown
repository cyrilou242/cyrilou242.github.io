## Hey, I'm Cyril.  

I'm a data engineer, currently at [AB Tasty][abtasty]. 
CS and NLP engineer by education, I am based in Paris.     
My engineering interest lies in streaming systems, data warehousing, data quality and exploration/exploitation problems.
In terms of business, I'm mostly interested in cloud offerings, open source business models and engineering tools/platforms.     

When I started this blog, I wanted to write about NLP. After a year and a half with exactly zero article, 
I finally admitted I was not interested (and relevant) anymore in the field. Nowadays, I'm mostly sharing podcast [I find interesting](./2021-07-28-podcasting-pearls-en.html) and little news.  

Outside of technology, I am a long distance runner at the Stade Fran√ßais. This blog will never deal with running so
feel free to check me out on [Strava][strava], 
or listen to my coach on [Spotify][dltc-spoti] 
and [Apple podcast][dltc-apple] (french content).

Any question or project, you can contact me through:
  - [Github][github] 
  - [Linkedin][linkedin]
  - [Medium][medium]
  - directly at `cdecatheu` on hey.com mail.
