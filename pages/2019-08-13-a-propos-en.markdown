## Hey, I'm Cyril.

I'm a data engineer, currently at [AB Tasty](https://www.abtasty.com/).
CS and NLP engineer by education, I am based in Paris.  
My engineering interest lies in streaming systems, data warehousing, data quality, and exploration/exploitation problems. In terms of business, I'm mostly interested in cloud offerings, open-source business models, and engineering tools/platforms.

When I started this blog, I wanted to write about NLP. After a year and a half with exactly zero article, I finally admitted I was not interested (and relevant) anymore in the field. Nowadays, I'm mostly sharing podcasts [I find interesting](./2021-07-28-podcasting-pearls-en.html) and little news.

Outside of technology, I am a long-distance runner at the Stade FranÃ§ais. This blog will never deal with running but feel free to check me out on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/14548186).
