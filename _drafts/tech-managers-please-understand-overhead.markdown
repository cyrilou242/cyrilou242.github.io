Overhead in small teams: careful when assigning engineers.
Some managers do not seem to understand how overhead is distributed. 

Overhead can come from: operational toil, customer success, sync overhead (meetings), ...

The problem with overhead is that assuming engineers are doing what is right, the overhead is legit. It is not compressible without going for an automation effort. What happens is that once everything is automated, overhead .

Let's say your team is running at 40% toil and overhead. It's a bit high but in a startup it can happen. Remember I'm including some level of support and customer success, customer calls.
So if you have 3 engineers, you end up with this: 

60%  60%  60%
40%  40%  40%

Now let's say the managers want's to move an eng to a different product: 

Somehow the managers assume the work is now: 

60+30%   60+30%
40%      40%

Where in fact it is: 

40+20%  40+20%
where the 20% are very hard to optimize for: it's work that has to be done: if an eng was taking 1/2 recruting interviews per week, 2 meetings with customer, 2 hours of hard to automate ops and 1 hour of ad-hoc debugging and 1 hour of meeting with a team for cross, ~1 day.

Of course this will not distribute like this. Either: 
- some eng will go for more. This eng will either get frustrated
- some parts will got cut. What
