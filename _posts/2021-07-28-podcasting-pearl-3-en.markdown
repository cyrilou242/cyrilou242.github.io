Magic The Gathering always lives in a bubble.  
Cards can be sold for tens to hundreds of dollars.   
Magic stakeholders have understood that this kind of bubble can burst.  

They have: 
- analysed bubbles of the same type
- implemented strategies to entertain the bubble:
    - print boosters depending on the market booster price, to make booster price constant
    - create a second, demand generating market: "pro-league". In "pro-league", only new cards can be played
    - market researche on what type of card design/features is liked
    - differentiate reeditions from old editions to avoid "sad investors"
    

**Note:**  
This strategy is not specific to Magic. The "banlist" in Yu-Gi-Oh TCG is a good example of bubble entertainment.  
Konami controls both offer and demand.    
    
**Actionable:**   
Building this kind of market is financially very interesting.   
As a consumer, avoid these kinds of market at all costs.
