The average four-year-old child laughs 300 times a day. 
By contrast, it takes more than two months for the average 40-year-old adult to laugh that many times.

We stop trying to have humor around 25. This is highly correlated with work.

**Ways to get fun:**
1. observe what is true, not what is funny
2. make fun of it:
    - exaggeration
    - callbacks
    - etc...
    
**Laughing helps to build confidence:** 
- in your colleagues
- in yourself

**Actionable:**   
Don't be professional:
- act professional
- **be human**
